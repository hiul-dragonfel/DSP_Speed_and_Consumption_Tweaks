# DSP Speed ans Consumption Tweaks

***** source https://github.com/hiul-dragonfel/DSP_Speed_and_Consumption_Tweaks *****

This mod enables tweaking the speed at whitch cargo drones, vessels and Icarus can travel.
It also adjusts the enregy consumption of each 3 entities.

I made this mod to be able to make huge maps on Galactic scale 2 because the distances where too great and vessels where taking hours to travel subluminal and Icarus hadn't enought energy to travel interstelar.

Ofcourse compatible with GS2, I don't know if it is compatible with nebula

v 2.1.0 Added the possibility to change the travelling speed of the solar sail bullets and node rockets

v 2.0.1 changes now affect loaded saves

v 2.0.0 Update To make it work with the last game version.
		Total rewrite.
		Add Darkfog battle unit tweaks

v 1.5.2 Fixed indexes and values for changing energy consumption of vessels and drones in v0.10.32.25779.

v 1.5.1	Corrected an error in the code that removed tech level improvment to drone speed.
		Techlevel will apply correctly now. (carefull if you made the base speed high concider reducing it to more appropriate levels)

V 1.5.0 Added Icarus actual sail acceleration rate Tweak 

V 1.4.1 Dark Fog Bug Fix

V 1.4.0 Added Dark Fog Seed, Relay and Carrier speed modification

V 1.3.2 Code Cleanning

V 1.3.1 Correction to strange artefacts in the config module that appeared after the last update and corrupted the file

V 1.3.0 Bug correction : removed appostrophes in the config file's description string ......

V 1.2.0 Correction to the speed of vessels near planets (more aesthetic), correction to ETA computations.

V 1.1.0 Added debugging log outputs and corrected a major bug where computers with period as a decimal separator would crash the mod.

V 1.0.3 Correction to the manifest

V 1.0.2 Cleanup of the config file and the code

V 1.0.1 Removed log prints

V 1.0.0 Yesssss All the basic features are here Icarus, Ships, Drone and some extras (dependent on shipCruiseSpeed) DF carrier and Relay Stations.

V 0.0.6 Added Support for Logistics Drones and removed Coeficients from config File (also corrected some Typos)

V 0.0.5 First usable build to be put on Thunderstore. It implements the tweakings for Icarus Cruise and Warp Speed and there energy consumptions.

V 0.0.2 through 0.0.4 personnal testing

V 0.0.1 this is just me learning how to mod so no functionality are there and can potentialy harm your game so it is only for my own learning experience that it is here.
